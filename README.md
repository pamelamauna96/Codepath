# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Pamela Mauna**

Time spent: **about 30 - 35 hours** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://35f49bb5-5514-4d67-a359-785f422b8342@api.glitch.com/git/ruby-fuschia-deltadromeus

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [One of the challenges I encounter in the process of the memory game was the game logic
   portion. The main challenge I encounter was implementing the diagram into the code
   itself. While I understood the process of how it should run by reading the instruction,
   now when it was time to write the if and else blocks to execute the program correctly
   on what is already build on without creating bugs.To overcome this challenge,
   I did the following steps: I had to understand the if, else block and the condition
   inside each block. The logic of the if block is whether the statement is true, if
   the player gets the sequence correct, the player passes on to the next round, making
   the statement true. Now the else block is whether the condition is false, now if the
   player fails to get the sequence correct in the game the block of code than it becomes
   false meaning the player has lost. That was stated in the diagram by showing how the if
   and else statement would run, now would be implementing and executing the code. I also
   had some assistant from my mentor by helping me understand the if/else block in
   different forms and examples that lead me to understand how to correctly put it into
   the game logic section.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [
   One of the question I wonder is how would the game would’ve worked different in other types of devices? 
   - Would changing the screen not optimize the experience for the player ? 
   
   Also if so how would it be possible to integrate them into a plate form, that is accessible through 
   the AppStore or Google store for one to download it with ease ?
   
   One of the features that I would’ve liked to add to the game was the random generator to change the
   sequence, how would one actually call it into the script? 
   
   
   After completing the assignment, it intrigued me how all the functionality would work in the fullstack aspect?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring 
   certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had more time to work on this project I would like to make the game a little more interactive by adding 
   some of these features: a multi-player competitive mode, expanding the game for people with learning impairments
   by associating a specific noise to a certain color set for example for users who are colorblind, or adding a random 
   generator for the sequence so not every round starts off the same way each time. The multiplayer setting would include
   the option to play with friends and have a scoreboard shown on the screen to keep track of each person’s points. These 
   features would not only improve the general interface of the game but would also improve the user experience.]
