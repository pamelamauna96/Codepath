## Reflection Questions

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   []

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [
   One of the question I wonder is how would the game would’ve worked different in other types of devices? 
   - Would changing the screen not optimize the experience for the player ? 
   
   Also if so how would it be possible to integrate them into a plate form, that is accessible through 
   the AppStore or Google store for one to download it with ease ?
   
   One of the features that I would’ve liked to add to the game was the random generator to change the
   sequence, how would one actually call it into the script? 
   
   
   After completing the assignment, it intrigued me how all the functionality would work in the fullstack aspect?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring 
   certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had more time to work on this project I would like to make the game a little more interactive by adding 
   some of these features: a multi-player competitive mode, expanding the game for people with learning impairments
   by associating a specific noise to a certain color set for example for users who are colorblind, or adding a random 
   generator for the sequence so not every round starts off the same way each time. The multiplayer setting would include
   the option to play with friends and have a scoreboard shown on the screen to keep track of each person’s points. These 
   features would not only improve the general interface of the game but would also improve the user experience.]
